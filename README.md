# Rebeha-DevOps-Program
Rebeha DevOps resources to advance your knowledge in the DevOps filed and the people you can follow 

## what is Rabeha Scholorship?
It is a Training for women in the Information and Communications Technology (ICT) sector. Egyptian Council for Training and Development conducts this program under the UN Women – UNIDO Joint Programme framework, “Women Economic Empowerment for Inclusive and Sustainable Growth in Egypt.” <br/>

This program is implemented in partnership with the National Council for Women (NCW) and the Ministry of Trade and Industry (MoTI) with the generous support of Global Affairs Canada (GAC). <br/>

I was honored to be the instructor for the DevOps program. It was an outstanding experience, so I decided to share with the students more resources about the topics we discussed throughout the program to advance their knowledge and help them to grow.

The resources mentioned in this repo are based on my personal experience, so feel free to update and add any helpful resources you believe will be helpful for anyone interested in learning and growing in the DevOps field.
